## Description
A Monte Carlo ray tracer implementation using photon mapping. 

Currently supports:
- Intransparent materials using Oren-Nayar and Lambertian BRDFs.
- Photon mapping to increase performance and approximate indirect lighting.
- Transparent and reflective materials.

TODO: 
- Shadow photons.
- Caustics by photon mapping.
- kd-tree instead of octree.

## A few troubleshooting tips
- IMPORTANT: Use the 32-bit binaries (build using x86!). Otherwise GLM might bug out.

- OPTIONAL: Linker -> Command Line -> Add "/NODEFAULTLIB:MSVCRT /NODEFAULTLIB:LIBCMT"

- OPTIONAL: Remove warning LNK4099:

  - Change C/C++ -> Output Files -> Program Database File to: "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).pdb"

  - Change Linker -> Debugging -> Generate Program Database File to: "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).pdb"

- OPTIONAL: Adding /FORCE:MULTIPLE to the Linker command line helps remove errors LNK1169 and LNK2005.
